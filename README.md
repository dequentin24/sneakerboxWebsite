# My SneakerBox Site!

# Why did I make this app?
I use to be a sneakerhead myself and I wanted to try my hand at making a front page dedicated to sneakers. I was mimicking the front page of Nike's website while working on this project. This was the first project I did completely on my own. 
# How's it made
I made this static site by placing each piece of content in its own column and row and then just adjusting the size of each row/column for each window size(media inquiries). I also implemented bootstrap to help me make a fast footer and menu design!


## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
  npm run deploy
```

Note: This project is being hosted on Cloudflare so you can view
